# Crafting Interpreters - Lox Interpreter in Rust

This repository contains yet another implementation of the `Lox` programming language interpreter in `Rust`, based on the book "[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)" by Bob Nystrom.

## What is Lox?

`Lox` is a simple, dynamically-typed programming language that was created by Bob Nystrom as a teaching language for his book "Crafting Interpreters". It supports basic control flow constructs, such as conditionals and loops, and has first-class functions and closures.

## Why Rust?

`Rust` is a modern systems programming language that provides the speed and low-level control of C or C++, while also offering memory safety and thread safety guarantees at compile time. It also has a growing ecosystem of libraries and tools that make it an ideal language for building interpreters and compilers.

## Getting Started

To get started with this interpreter implementation, clone this repository and follow the instructions in the book "Crafting Interpreters". The book walks you through the process of building a `Lox` interpreter from scratch in `Java` and `C`, but this repository contains an implementation in `Rust`.

## Related Notebooks

This repository also contains a collection of notebooks that I used to make notes while reading the book. These notebooks contain ideas and concepts that I found interesting, that are meant to be read alongside the book, and are not a substitute for it.

The notebooks are written in `Typst`, and located in the `notes/CraftingInterpreter TODOList` directory. The online version for the notebooks is hosted on `Typst app` and can be found [here](https://typst.app/project/rBOa6deJET7SK-OR-reQg2).
