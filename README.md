# Crafting Interpreters - Lox Interpreter in Rust

This repository contains yet another implementation of the `Lox` programming language interpreter in `Rust`, based on the book "[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)" by Bob Nystrom.

## What is Lox?

`Lox` is a simple, dynamically-typed programming language that was created by Bob Nystrom as a teaching language for his book "Crafting Interpreters". It supports basic control flow constructs, such as conditionals and loops, and has first-class functions and closures.

## Why Rust?

`Rust` is a modern systems programming language that provides the speed and low-level control of C or C++, while also offering memory safety and thread safety guarantees at compile time. It also has a growing ecosystem of libraries and tools that make it an ideal language for building interpreters and compilers.

## Getting Started

To get started with this interpreter implementation, clone this repository and follow the instructions in the book "Crafting Interpreters". The book walks you through the process of building a `Lox` interpreter from scratch in `Java` and `C`, but this repository contains an implementation in `Rust`.
